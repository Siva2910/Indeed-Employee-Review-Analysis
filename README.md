# Indeed-Employee-Review-Analysis-NLP

# Introduction

Online company review sites such as Indeed and Glassdoor facilitated the use of employer branding. For example, any employee, whether former or current, can review their experience with a company by giving a star rating and providing feedback. As the result, those looking to apply to positions at that company will know whether itâ€™s worth doing.
The surveys of users of company review sites supported the need for proper brand management, especially negative reviews. For example, a recent compilation of recruiting stats by Glassdoor revealed that 83 percent of job seekers were likely to research company reviews before deciding whether to apply. Clearly, an increasing number of people use online resources to get more information about companies and certain aspects such as salary data of benefits.
